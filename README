Scanned with (TODO: name of scanner) overhead camera, provided by the
University of Michigan's Hatcher Library.

Unfortunately, there are a few pages that did not quite lay flat, and are
difficult to read close to the spine. You may have to zoom in a lot and
mentally fill in the last couple characters.

Are there any completely indecipherable sections?
